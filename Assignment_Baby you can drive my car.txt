Assignment: Using Java or Scala, write  classes and methods representing a high level Objected Oriented Design for an automobile.

Please include classes for major functional components--Car, wheels, engine, etc

The overall goal is to model the sequence of events that happens when a person gets in a car and drives around the block.

	Here's a short (non-exhaustive) list reasonable methods that should be callable on appropriate components:
	InsertKey 
	RemoveKey
	TurnKey
	PressBrake
	ReleaseBrake
	PressGas
	ReleaseGas
	SteerLeft
	SteerStraight
	SteerRight
	PutCarInPark
	PutCarInDrive
	PutCarInReverse

Input-- 
from the main method from the car class, please call a sequence of methods representing a short drive.

Output:
After each call, the application should output a message detailing the car's current state, (along with reasonable error messages)
	"The car is off"
	"The engine is running"
	"The car is moving forward"
	"The car is turning left"
	"Error: You just tried to put the car in park while it was moving forward!"
	etc.
	
Note: This is not intended to be a detailed simulation. You can assume that if the car is on, in drive, and you press the gas pedal, that the car simply goes to a state of "driving forward"
How many components contribute to that happening is up to you.
